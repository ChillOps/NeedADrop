## Security Features

- No default credentials exposed
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- Isolated file storage per upload link
- Input validation and sanitization

- CORS protection
- Dependency vulnerability monitoring

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NeedADrop
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Manual Docker Build

1. Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t needadrop .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name needadrop \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v needadrop_data:/app/data \
  -v needadrop_uploads:/app/uploads \
  needadrop
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- SQLite 3

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd NeedADrop
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cargo build
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
cargo run
```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database path (default: `sqlite://needadrop.db`)
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Directory for file uploads (default: `./uploads`)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: `3000`)
- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (default: `info`)

## Security Audit

Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-audit

# Run security audit
cargo audit
```

## Docker Security

The Docker setup includes several security best practices:

- **Multi-stage build**: Minimizes final image size and attack surface
- **Non-root user**: Application runs as unprivileged user
- **Alpine Linux**: Minimal base image with fewer vulnerabilities
- **Read-only filesystem**: Container filesystem is read-only except for specific directories
- **Dropped capabilities**: Minimal Linux capabilities
- **Health checks**: Container health monitoring
- **Tini init system**: Proper signal handling and zombie process reaping

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main upload interface
- `POST /upload` - Upload files
- `GET /admin` - Admin login page
- `POST /admin/login` - Admin authentication
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `GET /admin/uploads` - View uploaded files
- `POST /admin/delete/<file_id>` - Delete files
- `GET /admin/change-password` - Change password form
- `POST /admin/change-password` - Update password
- `POST /admin/logout` - Admin logout
- `GET /files/<link_id>/<filename>` - Download files

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- `upload_links`: Stores upload link information and quotas
- `uploaded_files`: Stores file metadata and paths
- `admin_users`: Stores admin credentials (hashed)

- 🔒 **Secure Upload Links**: Administrators create unique, secure upload links with tokens
- ⏰ **Time-Limited Links**: Links can expire after a specified time period
- 📏 **Quota-Based Size Limits**: Set total upload quota per link that decreases with each upload
- 👤 **Guest Isolation**: Each guest upload is stored in a separate, isolated folder
- 🛡️ **Admin-Only Access**: Only administrators can view, download, and manage uploaded files
- 🗄️ **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database for storing metadata
- 🎨 **Clean Web Interface**: Modern, responsive web interface for both guests and admins
- 📊 **Grouped File Management**: Files are organized and displayed by upload link

## Quick Start

cargo run
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Default Admin Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

⚠️ **Important**: Change the default password immediately after first login in a production environment.

## Usage

### For Administrators

1. **Login**: Go to `/login` and use the admin credentials
2. **Create Upload Links**: 
   - Navigate to "Manage Upload Links"
   - Click "Create New Link"
   - Set a descriptive name, total upload quota (not per-file limit), and optional expiration time
   - Share the generated upload URL with guests
3. **Manage Uploads**: View all uploaded files grouped by upload link, download them, or delete unwanted uploads
4. **Change Password**: Update admin credentials through the account settings

### For Guests

2. **Upload Files**: Select and upload files within the remaining quota limits
3. **Multiple Uploads**: Continue uploading until the quota is exhausted
4. **Confirmation**: Receive confirmation when each upload is successful

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:needadrop.db
```

### File Storage

- Each guest upload gets its own isolated folder
- Folder structure: `uploads/{guest-folder-uuid}/{stored-filename}`

## API Endpoints

### Public Routes
- `GET /` - Home page
- `GET /upload/{token}` - Upload form for guests
- `POST /upload/{token}` - Handle file upload
- `GET /login` - Admin login form
- `POST /login` - Handle admin login
